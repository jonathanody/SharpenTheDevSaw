# Sharpen The Dev Saw
A little bit of self development a day goes a long way over a year - http://sharpenthedevsaw.azurewebsites.net/

As a keen believer of continuous learning, I am often asked how it is possible to fit continuous learning into daily life? 30 minutes a day does not sound like a lot but over a year, its 10950 minutes or 183 hours. Now think what you could learn with all that time? 

Sharpen The Dev Saw aims to show you what you could achieve with a little investment each day. Take a look, you might be surprised (and hopefully enthused too).
